# MobileBgWatch
This is a work-in-progress web app that allows you to easily monitor specific searches from mobile.bg

# A quick guide:

1. Go to <a href="https://www.mobile.bg/" target="_blank">Mobile.bg</a> and select your desired filters. After that, click on Search.

2. Copy the generated link, paste it here and click Add. During the police car gif, the program is going through all pages of the search link and getting all vehicles.

3. If everything went well, you should see the first 40 vehicles on the front page for each search link.

4. You can refresh a search link to get new vehicle ads and update the current ones in the database.

5. When you open the vehicle page, you can see all the relevant information, including price history.

The rest of the options you can check out for yourself. My plan is to implement a 'Favorites' page where you can add individual vehicle ads and keep track of them. I will also implement a service when the site is deployed to update the database for each user search link automatically and send emails to them about new vehicle ads. I have a few other ideas that I hope to integrate as well later in time.
